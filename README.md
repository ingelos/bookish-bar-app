## 1. Description
On Bookish Bar users can search for books and save them to a personal page (MyBooks).
Users can search by title/author or browse through different subjects. 
Once a book is saved the user can change the status of a book from 'want to read' to 'read' and rate the book by a star rating system.
This provides the user with an overview of all their read books and favorites.
Never again a conversation has to end because one can't remember the authors name, or title, or any detail from between the front and back cover except that it was great!

This project was set up with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/guide/) (React version 18.2.0)

The NOVI Educational Backend was used for this application. The backend runs on a Heroku server. The database of users empties within an hour.
